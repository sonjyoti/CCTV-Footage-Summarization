A modular and scalable system for automatic CCTV video summarization using motion-based frame selection, object detection, and video summarization.
The system eliminates redundant footage and efficiently highlights important events.

## Problem Statement

**Long-duration CCTV videos are difficult to analyze manually due to:**

- High redundancy

- Large storage requirements

- Limited actionable events

**This project addresses these challenges by:**

- Selecting only motion-relevant frames

- Applying object detection selectively

- Generating concise summary videos

## System Overview

**The pipeline consists of three independent modules, orchestrated by a master controller:**

- Frame Selection – Motion-based keyframe extraction

- Object Detection – YOLO-based detection on selected frames

- Summarization – Frame-to-video summary generation

Each module is reusable, independent, and scalable.
